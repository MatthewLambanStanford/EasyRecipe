      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>2 lbs. pork shoulder, cubed - </strong>  This cut of meat has the right amount of fat and muscle, making it perfect for slow cooking. The fat melts during cooking, adding richness to the stew.</li>
          <li> <strong>1 1/4 cups pork blood - </strong>Gives the stew its unique flavor and dark color. Dinuguan it is not complete without pork blood. If it is your first time, do not worry! Our recipe ensures the blood is thoroughly cooked, making it delicious and not as intimidating as you might think. </li>
          <li> <strong>4 pieces long peppers - </strong> Add a mild heat to the dish. There is something special about dinuguan with long peppers; their taste balances the savory flavor perfectly.</li>
          <li><strong>2 pieces onion - </strong> I love to use more onions because they enhance the dishes flavor. It isbest to mince the onions and cook them until they become soft and start to caramelize.</li>
          <li><strong>6 cloves garlic - </strong> Adds a strong, aromatic flavor.</li>
          <li><strong>2 cups water - </strong> This is used to create the stew base. Too much water can make this dinuguan unappealing and too runny. We aim for a consistency that is slightly thick but not overly so.</li>
          <li><strong>¾ cup white vinegar - </strong> Adds a tangy flavor and helps tenderize the meat. It also prevents the dinuguan from becomin
        </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Heating Oil and Sautéing:</strong> Heat oil in a pot. Sauté chopped onions for about 30 seconds, then add minced garlic. Cook until onions soften and begin to caramelize.</li>
          <li><strong>Browning the Pork Shoulder:</strong> Add cubed pork shoulder and ears. Sauté for 3 to 5 minutes until the pork starts to brown.</li>
          <li><strong>Adding the Vinegar:</strong> Pour vinegar into the pot and stir quickly. This adds sourness and reduces the gamey flavor of the blood.</li>
          <li><strong>Adding Water and Spices:</strong> Add water and bring to a boil. Add dried bay leaves and lemongrass. Re-boil to blend the flavors.</li>
          <li><strong>Simmering Until Tender:</strong> Simmer for about 1 hour, adding more water as needed. This makes the pork tender and flavorful.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixing in Peppers and Pork Blood:</strong> Add long green peppers and pour in pork blood. Stir and cook over low to medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes to avoid curdling.</li>
          <li><strong>Balancing the Flavor with Sugar:</strong> Add sugar, salt, and black pepper to taste. Stir well to combine.</li>
          <li><strong>Serve Hot with Rice or Puto:</strong> Enjoy your Dinuguan warm with steamed white rice or Filipino puto.</li>
